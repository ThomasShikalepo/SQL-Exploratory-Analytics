# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I’m **Thomas Shikalepo**, a student passionate about transforming raw datasets into meaningful, decision-ready insights. I enjoy using SQL to uncover patterns in data, supporting teams with clear, actionable reports instead of just numbers.

## 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

### 🎯 Objective  
The aim of this project is to showcase how SQL can be used to **explore**, **analyze**, and **summarize** retail sales data within a data warehouse structure. This project covers customer demographics, product categories, transactional sales, and key performance metrics.

---

### 📁 Dataset Description  
The data comes from a star schema in the `DataWarehouseAnalytics.gold` schema. Key tables include:

- **`dim_customers`** – Contains customer details like gender, birthdate, and country  
- **`dim_products`** – Provides product-related information including category, subcategory, and cost  
- **`fact_sales`** – Sales transactions including order date, quantity, and revenue

### 🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Schema and table exploration using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
- Aggregations: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Date calculations using `DATEDIFF`, `MIN`, and `MAX`
- Data grouping, filtering, and sorting with `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`
- Table joins across dimensions and facts
- Window functions such as `RANK() OVER`
- Summary report creation using `UNION ALL`
